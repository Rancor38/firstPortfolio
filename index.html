            <b>Hello! I'm Zakariah, and I recently became a software engineer, learning CSS and JavaScript at General Assembly! Here's how I got here:</b>
            <p>My personal purpose in life has always been to make things better than I found them. I like helping people and making others happy, and so from a young age I was drawn towards the arts. Theatre, music, and writing, were all passions of mine, and they are today.
            But when I turned 19, I moved out. I wanted to move out, and no one that I knew at age 19 had done it, and this meant that I needed to work.<br>
            So I got my first "real" job at Knott’s Berry Farm, where I had worked a Summer job before, but in a new line of work: food service. I realized that in food service I was able to help make people’s day, and I learned to engage people.
            But then, I had a job offer at a cafe… now I love coffee, but at the time I had never drank it before in my life. I couldn’t have been a worse fit! But I told myself, that if I was being hired on as a Barista, that I was going to learn everything.<br>
            I dove head-in, and I mastered my art in a few short years. I’ve visited coffee farms during my vacation in Hawaii; I love coffee, as much as I like helping people. I took that skill and I moved up in the company, bringing my joy for my work with me every step of the way. 
            But 2020 was a rough year, and it put strains on me, on my family, and during that year and the one that followed, I lost some loved ones.<br>
            It makes you think about things, and I realized that time is precious, and that while I do love coffee, that there were other pursuits that I had neglected. When I was a kid, I wanted to create things. My father is a carpenter, my mother is a writer, so growing up I was always surrounded by people who created things.<br>     
            Now as a small digression, I play Dungeons and Dragons. It's a fun pasttime and a creative outlet. I run a game, sometimes multiple at once, that tend to run on a week by week basis, and playing a game that is pretty nerdy means: I have a lot of friends in the tech industry.<br>
            For years these friends tried to convince me to get into tech… They all told me it would be tough to make the change, but that it’d be worth it. If I was going to change directions, change the course of my life, and learn a new skill, now was the time.<br>
            <p>So I said my goodbyes to Starbucks, and signed up for General Assembly, and that, is where I find myself today, and I’m having a blast knowing that the best of times are yet ahead.</p>
