I will be making a portfolio
On this portoflio, as a user I want to be able to:
See who Zak is, and what he has accomplished.
Be able to navigate the website for any relevant details easily.

MVP
Build a single-page application with a home page with a carousel
3 sub pages on carousel.
Add a navigation-bar
make the site change the navigation bar on mobile.
Subpages are a bio, my projects, and my resume.
