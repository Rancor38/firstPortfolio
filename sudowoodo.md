I will be making a portfolio
On this portoflio, as a user I want to be able to:
See who Zak is, and what he has accomplished.
Be able to navigate the website for any relevant details easily.

MVP

3 sub pages on carousel.
Add a navigation-bar

Subpages are a bio, my projects, and my resume.
Make the projects pictures into proper hyperlinked images.
Add an overlay over the page that greets the user.
Add links to Github and LinkedIn (Absolutes on right side of screen, or on navbar)
Update the README
